**query-json (q)** is a [faster](#Performance) and simpler re-implementation of the [jq language](https://github.com/stedolan/jq/wiki/jq-Language-Description) in [Reason Native](https://reasonml.github.io/docs/en/native) and compiled to binary thanks to OCaml. **q**, allows you to write small programs to operate on top of json files in a cute syntax:

```bash
q ".store.books | filter(.price > 10)" stores.json
```

This would access to `"store"` field inside the **stores.json**, access to `"books"` field, (since it's an array) it will run a filter on each item and if `"price"` field is bigger than 10 will keep that item on the list, and finally print the resultant list.

```json
[
  {
    "title": "War and Peace",
    "author": "Leo Tolstoy",
    "price": 12.0
  },
  {
    "title": "Lolita",
    "author": "Vladimir Nabokov",
    "price": 13.0
  }
]
```

## It brings

- **Great Performance**: Fast, small footprint and minimum run-time. Check [Performance section](#Performance) for a longer explaination.
- **Delightful errors**:
  - Better errors when json types and operation types don't match:
    ```bash
    $ esy q -- '.esy.release.wat' esy.json
    Error: Trying to .wat on `{"bin": ["q"]}` and it does not exist.
    ```
  - `verbose` flag, prints each operation in each state and it's intermediate states. _(Work in progress...)_
  - `debug` prints the tokens and the AST.
- **Improved API**: made small adjustments to the buildin operations. Some examples are:
  - All methods are snake_case instead of alltoghetercase
  - Changed `select` for `filter`
  - Supports comments in JSONs
- **Small**: Lexer, Parser and Compiler are just 300 LOC and most of the commands that I use on my day to day are implemented in only 140 LOC.

## Installation

### Using a bash script

Check the content of [scripts/install.sh](./scripts/install.sh) before running anything in your local. [Friends don't let friends curl | bash](https://sysdig.com/blog/friends-dont-let-friends-curl-bash).
```
curl -sfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davesnx/query-json/master/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

### Using npm

```
npm install --global @davesnx/query-json
```

### Using yarn

```
yarn global add @davesnx/query-json
```

### Download zip files from [GitHub](https://github.com/davesnx/query-json/releases)

## Performance

[This report](./benchmarks/report.md) is not a exaustive performance report of both tools, it's a overview for the percived performance of the user. Here I don't profile each tool and trying to see what are the bootlenecks, since I asume that both tools have the penalty of parsing a JSON file. Simply run a bash script and analyze the results.

Aside from that, **q** isn't feature parity with **jq** which is ok at this point, but **jq** contains a ton of functionality that q misses and some of the **jq** operations aren't native, are builtin with the runtime. In order to do a proper comparision all of this above would need to take into consideration.

The report shows that **q** is between 2x and 5x faster than **jq** in all operations tested and same speed (~1.1x) with huge files (> 100M).

## Purpose

The purposes of this project were mostly 2:

- **Learn how to write a lexer/parser/compiler with the OCaml stack** using menhir and sedlex while trying to create a compiler with great error messages and possibly recoverability (currently _work in progress_).
- **Create a CLI tool in Reason Native** and being able to distribute it as a binary, enjoy it's performance and try further with cross-compilation.
